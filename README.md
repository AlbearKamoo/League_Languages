DISCLAIMER: this application is merely a PROOF OF CONCEPT for how it is technically feasible for a feature like this to be implemented into the League of Legends game client. The League of Legends game and client are the property of Riot Games. I do not know why Riot Games has not decided to impemented this feature, as it is programatically trivial but is an enormous boost to the game and client's quality of life.

# League_Languages
A simple desktop application that demonstrates that it is possible for a user to change the League of Legends client and game language regardless of server choice. This feature is useful for people like me who have accounts on multiple servers but prefer to play in a certain language, but it is not a feature that is currently implemented in League of Legends. In lieu of the ability to implement this feature directly to the game client, I have instead developed a simple and easy to use UI that demonstartes the same capabilities. 

In this application all one needs to do is to choose a language from the list and click OK and both the League of Legends game Client and in-game lanuages will be configured.
(Application is to be used while the League of Legends Client is closed)
