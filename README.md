# League_Languages
A simple desktop application that allows the user to change the League of Legends client and game language regardless of server choice. This is useful for people like me who have accounts on multiple servers but prefer to play in a certain language.

All one needs to do is to choose a language from the list and click OK and both the League of Legends game Client and in-game lanuages will be configured.
(Application is to be used while the League of Legends Client is closed)
